/**
 * Canonical representation for date/times where both UTC and
 * localtime must be representable and where localtime algebra, e.g.,
 * "same time yesterday", must computable.
 *
 * Draws from Joda-Time and the contents of the (never finalized)
 * Time-Zone/Timezone header draft spec
 * (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sharhalakis-httptz-05)
 *
 * The RFC draft specs the first field, called instance_us below, to
 * be formatted as rfc3339, a string that does not include fractional
 * seconds. We generalize to an epoch-relative 64bit integer in
 * microseconds and store the timezone offset separately.
 *
 * We choose microseconds (usec) over milliseconds (msec) because on
 * mobile devices multiple things of interest can occur within the
 * same millisecond. The cost of usec over msec when the last three
 * digits are 0 is ~1 byte. The instance_us type is signed, to allow
 * for pre-epoch dates but not sint64 since virtually all dates should
 * be post-epoch.
 *
 * tz_names are defined in the tz database:
 *
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database
 *
 * Using an enum was considered, prototyped, and rejected: the version
 * of the database varies by platform and distribution and can't be
 * relied upon to be in sync with an enum.
 *
 * Storing the timezone offset is insufficient in the face of daylight
 * savings time, e.g., you can't represent "same hour of the day
 * yesterday". As long as tz_name is known, tz_offset is not needed
 * but tz_name is not always available. Joda-Time stores
 * timezone_offset as msec, which is a understandable since Joda
 * pretty much stores everything in msec. Storing it in usec (to be
 * the same as instance_usec) seems of little value since the current
 * most significant use is quarter hours.
